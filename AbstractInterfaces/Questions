1)1. What is the difference between an abstract class and interface class? (3-5)
	Interfaces cannot have states and instance variables.  You can have an interface in an abstract class, but not vice versa.
	The main difference is that abstract classes can be partially abstract, while interfaces must be fully abstract.

2. Do all public classes that implement an interface need to implement all the methods?
Which type of class avoids this rule(1-2)
	Yes, all methods of an interface must be implemented.
	Abstract classes do not need to implement interface methods.

3. If a class extends an abstract class , do all the methods need to be implemented? When
and why?(1-2)
	Only the abstract methods need to be implemented if the subclass is not another abstract class.
	If the subclass is an abstract class, it does not need to implement the methods.

4. Can you instantiate an object of type abstract?(1-2)
	An abstract class cannot be instantiated.

5. What is the difference between extend and implement?(2-3)
	Extends is used for class inheritance, and implies that you are extending a parent class with more methods
	in the child class.  Implements is used with interfaces and implies that you are adding the functionality of
	an interface to a class.
